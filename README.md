# Spring-Boot and Camel XML QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to configure Camel routes in Spring Boot via a Spring XML configuration file.

The application utilizes the Spring [`@ImportResource`](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html) annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a [camel-context.xml](src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml) file on the classpath.

### Building

The example can be built with

    mvn clean install

### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)

The example can be built and run on OpenShift using a single goal:

    mvn fabric8:deploy

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the running pods, and view logs and much more.

### Running via an S2I Application Template

Application templates allow you deploy applications to OpenShift by filling out a form in the OpenShift console that allows you to adjust deployment parameters.  This template uses an S2I source build so that it handle building and deploying the application for you.

First, import the Fuse image streams:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/fis-image-streams.json

Then create the quickstart template:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-xml-template.json

Now when you use "Add to Project" button in the OpenShift console, you should see a template for this quickstart.

route "camel-springboot-restdsl-ssl" created

# Camel AMQP+SSL application publishing messages in a AMQ Broker in Openshift 

This example shows how to connect an external application (outside Openshift) to an AMQ xPaaS message broker inside Openshift using the router via SSL/TLS.

The cool thing about this methodology is the capability to route the traffic to non HTTP ports (TCP) via HTTPS port. On this example I exposed the AMQP port.

Doc: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_a-mq/6.3/html-single/red_hat_jboss_a-mq_for_openshift/

## Requirements

Openshift cluster up and running.

    mvn clean install

## Setup

### AMQ Setup

1. Generate certificates to use in the broker and the client application (this one)

    openshift-setup/certs-setup.sh

2. Deploy the AMQ Broker

    openshift-setup/setup.sh

3. Run the application to test

    mvn spring-boot:run

If everything works you should see the messages being produced and consumed in a AMQ queue.
